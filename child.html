       <h2>what is child labour</h2>
       
       <p>The term “child labour” is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. 
           It refers to work that: is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children</p>
        <h2>Why does it occur</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Low family income – adults in the family are unemployed or have extremely low wages.
                They do not earn enough to cover the family’s costs. This can also mean they do not
                have savings so are vulnerable to any economic / financial shocks, such as increasing
                prices for necessities like food</li>
                <li>Debt – in order to cover costs, particularly large unexpected costs such as medical bills,
                    the family borrows money and may become “debt-bonded” where their labour is used in
                    exchange for the loan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inter-generational – if parents were child labourers themselves, it can be seen as
                        tradition or appropriate for children to work, particularly if they are expected to work for
                        and eventually take over the family small business or farm</li>
                       </p>
